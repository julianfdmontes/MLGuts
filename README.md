Â¿Do you think DataScience is randomly pick up a black box algorithm for your cooked dataset and press enter? No, it is not.
Program algorithms from scratch allow data scientists a de adquire a deep knowlege about their own work.

There is nothing wrong using all the good libraries avaiables on python framework, "god" save sklearn, tensorflow, spark ml... but in order to get better in our understanding of those libraries is essential exploring most famous algorithm guts.
