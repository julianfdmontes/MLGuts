Â¿Do you think DataScience is randomly pick up a black box algorithm for your cooked dataset and press enter? No, it is not.
Program algorithms from scratch allow data scientists adquire a deep knowlege about their own work.

There is nothing wrong using all the good libraries avaiables on python framework, "god" save sklearn, tensorflow, spark ml... but in order to get better in our understanding of those libraries is essential exploring most famous algorithm guts.

## 1. Algorithms

### 1.1 Regressions

#### 1.1.1 Linear Regression
*Linear regression is first stone in our Machine Learning knowledge castle.*

#### 1.1.2 Logistict Regression
*Logistic regression is the door to Deep Learning.*


### 1.2 Empiricals

#### 1.2.1 KNN
*The favourite algorithm for Euclides.*

#### 1.2.2 Naive Bayes
*The favourite algorithm for Bayes.*

### 1.3 Choising Trees


#### 1.3.1 Decission Tree
*Shuffling data.*
Ejemplod e como hace binning vs regresion lineal.


#### 1.3.2 Random Forest
*Democracy as machine learning strategy.*
